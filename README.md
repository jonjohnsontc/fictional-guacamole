# 1brc in C

This is my personal attempt at creating a baseline, and subsequent improvements on runtime of the 1brc in the C Programming Language.

I don't have a particular target implementation of the language, but I would eventually like to try it with the Cake compiler using C23 features

Original challenge source: https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc

I don't plan on creating novel / submission worthy implementations, rather I'd like to get a better understanding of the tradeoffs for different ways of processing data, and the types of optimizations that can be good.
